      <p>The   current education system does not focus on training young people in   employable skills that can provide them with employment opportunities.   Today, a large section of India’s labor force has outdated skills. With   current and expected economic growth, this challenge is going to only   increase further, since more than 75% of new job opportunities are   expected to be “skill-based.”</p>
      <p>Therefore we strongly emphasize on upgrading people’s skills by providing vocational education and training to them. </p></td>
